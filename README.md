# Chat App - Frontend Mentor

I tested my CSS skills building a mobile component for a chat app following the Frontend Mentor design and styling guidances.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build a feature illustration and get it to look as close to the [design](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/chat-app-css-illustration-O5auMkFqY) as possible. 

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See the chat interface animate on the initial load

## Technologies

React v16.13.1

## Setup

Clone this repo git clone https://github.com/lauracarballo/chat-app to your desktop and run npm install to install all the dependencies.

## To run the project

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.
